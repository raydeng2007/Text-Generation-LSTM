    <h2>Here's Why (And a brief intro to how this thing works exactly)</h2>
    <p>
        Using the correct model and tweaking the parameters are very important for the accuracy of the machine learning
        model. <br>
        However no matter how well we choose the parameters, any machine learning model's accuracy and precision come at a cost of
        long training times and an abundance of data. <br>
        For this project the model only used part of Trumps' tweets because the entirety of his tweets would take a bit to long to
        process, the model was also trained with cloud GPU and each epoch did indeed take up to 2.5 hours.
        The model was trained on 14 epochs with a final loss value of 1.4507. <br>
        It's quite obvious that the model needs more tweaking and training to get better results, for more information on how it is
        built and how LSTM models work. click <a href="https://www.google.com"> here</a>.
